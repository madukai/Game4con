## Breakdown of the project
```
1.) Before starting this project I need to watch amd read documentations about VUE.js since I don't have any exposure
or knowledge working with VUE.js and learn the core concepts and fundamentals of it. 
(1.5 hrs)

2.) Setting up the project using the files that was provided to me, unfortunately I run into issue when I run the VUE project
since it has npm error, I've decided to just start from the scratch, though I was still able to use base logic (app.j) that was provided as my starting point.
(1.5 hrs)

3.) Work on implementing additional logic and algorithm for AI part of the game, when the user selects a column and get the event data, determine the win condition and bug testing and fixing 
(2.5 hrs)

4.) Put an image for player 1 (Spongebob) and AI (Squidward) and clean the code. 
(1 hr)

This project gave me the opportunity to work on VUE.js framework, I had fun working on this project and the challenge.
